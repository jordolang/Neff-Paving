# Security Best Practices - Neff Paving

## Overview

This document outlines security best practices for the Neff Paving system, including frontend, backend, and environment configurations. These practices ensure data integrity, user privacy, and overall system security.

## General Security Principles

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant permissions necessary for each user's role.
- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security to protect assets.
- **Secure by Default**: Default configurations should be the most secure possible.
- **Fail Securely**: Ensure error handling does not expose sensitive information.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all software, dependencies, and systems patched and updated.

## Frontend Security

### HTTP Headers

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevent cross-site scripting and data injection.
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Protect against cross-site scripting attacks.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevent MIME-sniffing attacks.
- **Referrer-Policy**: Control referer information sent with requests.
- **Permissions-Policy**: Control access to browser features (e.g., microphone, camera).

### Secure Input Handling

- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs both client-side and server-side.
- **Sanitization**: Sanitize inputs to remove or encode malicious characters.
- **Encoding**: Encode outputs to escape HTML, JS, and SQL injections.
- **Error Messages**: Keep error messages generic to avoid revealing system information.

### Session and Cookies

- **Secure Cookies**: Use `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` attributes.
- **Session Management**: Use short-lived tokens with automatic expiration.
- **HTTPS-Only**: Serve content over HTTPS to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Backend Security

### API Security

- **Authentication**: Use JWT-based authentication with appropriate expiration.
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against denial-of-service attacks by limiting requests per IP.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Monitor API calls for anomalies and store logs securely.
- **Data Validation**: Validate and sanitize all data received by the server.

### Data Security

- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (TLS) and at rest.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration to avoid hardcoding.
- **Backup Strategy**: Regularly back up data and test restoration procedures.

### Code Security Practices

- **Static Code Analysis**: Regularly run linters and static analysis tools.
- **Code Reviews**: Implement code reviews to spot potential vulnerabilities.
- **Dependencies Management**: Use tools to manage and update dependencies security.

## Security for Services and Infrastructure

### Database Security

- **Access Control**: Grant minimal database access to the app user; no direct access from the public internet.
- **Parameterization**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- **Audit Logging**: Enable database auditing to monitor queries and changes.
- **Regular Backups**: Schedule automated backups and verify integrity.

### Cloud and Network Security

- **Firewall Configuration**: Restrict inbound/outbound traffic with security groups.
- **VPC and Subnet Isolation**: Use virtual private clouds to isolate services.
- **Key Management**: Use managed key services for cloud resource encryption.
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Enable MFA for cloud service access.

## Testing and Updates

- **Penetration Testing**: Perform regular penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities.
- **Patch Management**: Deploy patches for discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

## Incident Response Plan

1. **Preparation**: Have tools and contacts ready for quick response.
2. **Identification**: Confirm the existence of an incident.
3. **Containment**: Limit the scope of the breach while maintaining system operations.
4. **Eradication**: Remove threats and eliminate root causes.
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to full operation while monitoring for anomalous activities.
6. **Lessons Learned**: Analyze and document learnings to improve future responses.
