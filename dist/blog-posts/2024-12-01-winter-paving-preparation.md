# Preparing Your Pavement for Winter Weather

Ohio winters can be brutal on pavement. Freeze-thaw cycles, snow plowing, and de-icing chemicals all take their toll. Proper preparation can prevent costly spring repairs.

## Pre-Winter Inspection Checklist

- ✅ Seal all cracks larger than 1/8 inch
- ✅ Ensure proper drainage to prevent ice formation
- ✅ Check and repair any potholes
- ✅ Apply seal coat if it's been more than 3 years
- ✅ Clear debris from drainage systems

## Snow Removal Best Practices

### Use the Right Equipment
Rubber-edged plows prevent surface damage. Metal edges should only be used on heavily deteriorated surfaces.

### Plow Early and Often
Remove snow before it becomes compacted. Multiple light passes are better than one heavy push.

### Avoid Over-Salting
Excessive salt can damage both asphalt and concrete. Use sand for traction when temperatures are extremely low.

## De-Icing Chemical Considerations

### Rock Salt (Sodium Chloride)
- **Effective to:** 20°F
- **Pros:** Most common, inexpensive
- **Cons:** Can be harsh on pavement and vegetation

### Calcium Chloride
- **Effective to:** -10°F
- **Pros:** Works in lower temperatures
- **Cons:** More expensive but less damaging

### Magnesium Chloride
- **Effective to:** -5°F
- **Pros:** Most pavement-friendly option
- **Cons:** Higher cost but excellent for concrete

## Winter Damage Prevention Tips

1. **Create proper drainage** - Standing water leads to ice damage
2. **Fix cracks immediately** - Water expansion in cracks causes major damage
3. **Use fabric underneath gravel** - Prevents rutting and extends life
4. **Install snow stakes** - Protect edges during plowing
5. **Schedule regular inspections** - Catch problems before they worsen

## Emergency Winter Repairs

Sometimes winter damage happens despite preparation:

### Temporary Pothole Patches
- Use cold-mix asphalt for emergency repairs
- Keep area dry and compact thoroughly
- Plan for permanent repair in spring

### Ice Damage Management
- Remove ice carefully to prevent further damage
- Apply sand for immediate traction
- Document damage for spring repair planning

## Spring Damage Assessment

Schedule a professional inspection each spring to identify winter damage early. Common issues include:

- **Frost heave damage** - Uneven surfaces from freeze-thaw
- **Edge deterioration** - From snow plow damage
- **Crack expansion** - Water infiltration and freezing
- **Surface raveling** - Loss of surface aggregate

## Cost of Winter Damage

| Damage Type | Prevention Cost | Repair Cost |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Small cracks | $0.25/ft seal | $2-5/ft repair |
| Potholes | $500 drainage fix | $15-30/sq ft |
| Edge damage | $2/ft protection | $8-15/ft rebuild |
